### Partitioning
## Partitioning example

d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition select some_device_lvm

# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
# The same applies to pre-existing software RAID array:

# - atomic: all files in one partition
# - home:   separate /home partition

# but sending reports helps the project determine what software is most
# popular and include it on CDs.
popularity-contest popularity-contest/participate boolean false

### Boot loader installation

# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
